Apple's messaging network iMessage has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, though it has long been locked down to their platforms.
But now, AirMessage makes it easy to send and receive messages to your friends and family through group chats, images, videos and audio messages!

- Send and receive messages over iMessage
- Chat together with your friends in groups
- Share images, videos, documents and more

The F-Droid release of AirMessage for Android excludes certain features found in the main release, such as Sign In with Google and location attachments.

Please note that a Mac computer is required to use this app.
