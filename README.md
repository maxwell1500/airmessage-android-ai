## Getting started

AirMessage for Android uses [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) to manage its internal logic.
If you're not familiar with RxJava, the repository's README file is a great place to get started:

AirMessage for Android hooks in to Google Cloud and Firebase to utilize services like FCM, Google Maps, and Crashlytics.
The app will not build without a valid configuration, so to get started quickly, you can copy the `app/fullRelease/google-services.default.json` file to `app/fullRelease/google-services.json` to use a pre-configured Firebase project, or you may provide your own Firebase configuration file.
Similarly, the app will use the API key found in `secrets.default.properties` for Google Maps by default, and you can supply your own in `secrets.properties`.

## ðŸ¤– AI Features Setup (Ollama Integration)

AirMessage's AI features are powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), a self-hosted AI model server. To enable AI features:

### Setting up Ollama Server

1. **Install Ollama** on your server or local machine:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   iwr -useb https://ollama.ai/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

2. **Download and run the Gemma model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull orieg/gemma3-tools:4b
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **Configure your server**:
   - The app is pre-configured to connect to `maxwell15000.ddns.net:11434`
   - To use your own server, update the Ollama endpoint in the app settings
   - Ensure your server is accessible via HTTP (port 11434 by default)

### Enabling AI Features

1. **Sign in with Google**: AI features require Google account authentication
2. **Enable AI assistance**: Go to Settings â†’ AI Features and toggle on desired features:
   - Smart message enhancement
   - Context-aware smart replies
   - Real-time composition assistant
3. **Configure preferences**: Adjust tone settings and AI behavior to your liking

### AI Feature Details

- **Message Enhancement**: Uses the `orieg/gemma3-tools:4b` model to improve message quality
- **Smart Replies**: Generates contextually appropriate response suggestions
- **Composition Assistant**: Provides real-time writing assistance with debounced API calls
- **Fallback Support**: Automatically falls back to ML Kit and Android TextClassifier when Ollama is unavailable

## Building and running for AirMessage Connect

In order to help developers get started quickly, we host a separate open-source version of AirMessage Connect at `connect-open.airmessage.org`.
Firebase requires apps to be signed with a designated keystore file in order to enable Google-sign in, so you can copy the `signingshared/shared.keystore.disabled` file to `signingshared/shared.keystore`, which will cause Gradle to use this keystore file in debug builds instead of your local one.

Since this version of AirMessage Connect is hosted in a separate environment from official servers, you will have to be running a version of AirMessage Server that also connects to the same server.

We kindly ask that you do not use AirMessage's official Connect servers with any unofficial builds of AirMessage-compatible software.
